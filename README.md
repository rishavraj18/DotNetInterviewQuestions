## What is a string in C#? Why is it immutable?

Memory and performance optimization through interning.
If strings were mutable:
Changing one would accidentally change others referencing it.

Thread safety

## Difference between .NET Framework & .NET Core

| .NET Framework     | .NET Core / .NET                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Windows-only       | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)          |
| Not open-source    | Fully open-source                             |
| Monolithic         | Modular (NuGet-based)                         |
| Slower performance | High performance (Kestrel, JIT optimizations) |
| Legacy             | Modern / future platform                      |


-------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Dependency Injection in .NET Core?

How does DI work internally?
Register services (what types exist and their lifetimes).
Build a dependency graph (resolve constructor parameters).
Create instances (construct objects in the correct order).

When Registering:
Store metadata (type → implementation → lifetime)

When Resolving:
Lookup descriptor
Find constructor
Resolve dependencies recursively
Construct object (using cached delegates)
Cache it if singleton/scoped
Track if disposable

On Scope End:
Dispose scoped and transient disposables

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Service lifetimes – Transient, Scoped, Singleton

A) Transient
Creates a new instance every time
Light-weight, stateless services
Helper classes, utilities, Formatter, validators

B)Scoped
one instance per HTTP request
Same instance reused within the same request, New request = new instance
DbContext, Unit of Work pattern, Business logic that must stay consistent during one request

Inside Request #1:
Controller: instance A
Service A: instance A
Repository: instance A

Inside Request #2:
New instance B

C) Singleton
Only one instance in the entire application lifetime
Created once, reused forever
Same instance for all requests & all users
Cache services, Logging frameworks, Configuration providers

Only singleton/transient services are injected into middleware.
Scoped services are not allowed

-------------------------------------------------------------
## What are the key advantages of Dependency Injection (DI)

Loose Coupling, modularity, testability, maintainability, and flexibility
Easy Unit Testing (Mocking becomes simple)
Clean Code
Better Extensibility
Centralized Dependency Management
Promotes SOLID Principles

-------------------------------------------------------------
## What is mocking in Unit Testing ?

Mocking in NUnit means creating fake versions of dependencies 
so you can test your class without using the real implementations 
(like real database, email service, API calls, etc.).
-------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Does the Test Pass Even When No Real Email Was Sent?

using NUnit.Framework;
using Moq;

[TestFixture]
public class UserServiceTests
{
    [Test]
    public void Register_Should_Call_EmailService_Send()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockEmailService = new Mock<IEmailService>();

        var userService = new UserService(mockEmailService.Object);

        // Act
        userService.Register("test@example.com");

        // Assert
        mockEmailService.Verify(
            x => x.Send("test@example.com", "Welcome!"), 
            Times.Once
        );
    }
}

Because unit testing is NOT meant to test external systems(like email server, SMTP, database, API).
Unit test should test only the logic inside your class, not the dependencies.

In unit testing:
We do NOT test whether an email is actually delivered
We test whether our class attempted to send the email correctly
The email sending itself is tested in integration tests, not unit tests
-------------------------------------------------------------

## Explian Program.cs files component ?

WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args) sets up everything your application needs before it starts 
running — configuration, DI, logging, and hosting environment.

Step 1 — Create Builder
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

Step 2 — Register Services in DI Container
builder.Services.AddControllers();

Step 3 — Build the App
var app = builder.Build();

Step 4 — Configure Middleware
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();

Property				Purpose
builder.Services		Register DI services
builder.Configuration	Read config files
builder.Environment		Check environment (Dev/Prod)
builder.Logging			Configure logging
builder.WebHost			Configure Kestrel, URLs, etc.

## Explain the Request Pipeline in .NET Core

The request pipeline in ASP.NET Core is a sequence of middleware components that an HTTP request 
passes through before reaching an endpoint (controller, minimal API, Razor page), 
and then back out to produce the response.

ASP.NET Core creates a linked list of delegates representing each middleware in order
Incoming Request → Middleware #1 → Middleware #2 → ... → Endpoint → Response

Each middleware can:
Run logic before passing the request to the next middleware
Run logic after the next middleware has completed
Short-circuit the pipeline (stop it early)
Modify the request or response

-------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Middleware and how it executes?

A middleware is usually a class with:
A constructor that receives the next middleware delegate
An Invoke or InvokeAsync method that executes the logic

ASP.NET Core uses DI to construct middleware once at startup.
_next is the next middleware delegate in the pipeline.

public class LoggerMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public LoggerMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Before next middleware");

        await _next(context); // Call next component

        Console.WriteLine("After next middleware");
    }
}

app.UseMiddleware<LoggerMiddleware>();

Pipeline behavior is completely determined by the order you add middleware.

Middleware components are singletons

Scoped services used inside middleware must be resolved from:
context.RequestServices

Only app.Run() creates a terminal middleware
Meaning the pipeline ends there.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## What is Short-Circuiting the Pipeline ?

A middleware can decide NOT to call the next middleware:

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    if (!context.Request.Headers.ContainsKey("Auth"))
    {
        context.Response.StatusCode = 401;
        return; // Pipeline stops here
    }

    await next();
});


Used for:
Authentication failures
Authorization failures
Blocking invalid requests
Returning static files early
CORS failures

-------------------------------------------------------------

## What are constructors?
A constructor is a special method inside a class that runs automatically 
when you create (instantiate) an object.

Its job is to:
Initialize the object
Set default values
Inject dependencies

Same name as the class
No return type

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Parameterized vs Non-parameterized constructors

Feature				Non-parameterized				Parameterized
Takes arguments			❌ No						✔ Yes
Provides defaults		✔ Yes						❌ Caller must pass values
Used for DI				Rarely						Very commonly
Enforces rules			❌ No						✔ Yes
Flexibility				High						High but requires inputs
Auto-generated?			✔ Yes (if none defined)		❌ No

-------------------------------------------------------------

Method Overloading vs Method Overriding (examples)

Feature		        Method Overloading						 	Method Overriding
Concept		        Same method name, different signatures  	Same method name & signature in child class 
Polymorphism        compile-time polymorphism				 	runtime polymorphism
Occurs in	        Same class (or derived class)	         	Only in inheritance (base → derived class)
Parameters	        Must be different (type, number, order)	    Must be same
Return type	        Can be different							Must be same (or covariant)
Modifier needed?	No special keyword							Needs virtual in base + override in derived
Binding time	    Compile-time								Runtime
Purpose				Increase flexibility						Change/extend parent behavior

-------------------------------------------------------------
What are Delegates?
A delegate is a type-safe function pointer —
meaning it can hold a reference to a method, and you can call that method through the delegate.

✔ Type-safe → method signature must match the delegate
✔ Can point to static or instance methods
✔ Can point to multiple methods (multicast)
✔ Foundation for events, LINQ, async, Func<>, Action<>

-------------------------------------------------------------
Where Delegates Are Used ?

Delegates form the foundation for:
Events
LINQ expressions
Callbacks
Async/await
Middleware registration
Timer callbacks
Threading (Task.Run)

Example:

app.Use(async (context, next) => { ... });


This works because middleware takes RequestDelegate, which is a delegate type.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Explain async-await & asynchronous programming in C#

The method starts running.

When it hits await SomeTask:
It returns control to the caller.
It lets the thread do other work.

When the awaited task completes:
The method resumes from where it stopped.

This creates the illusion of "pausing," but really nothing is blocked.

async keyword
Marks a method as asynchronous and allows await to be used inside it.

await keyword
Pauses the method until the awaited task finishes, without blocking the thread.

Return type - Task or void
-------------------------------------------------------------
Wht to avoid Blocking Calls in Async Code

Never use:

.Result

.Wait()

.GetAwaiter().GetResult()

These cause deadlocks and block threads
-------------------------------------------------------------

Asynchronous programming
Asynchronous programming allows your application to perform tasks without blocking the main thread.
Instead of waiting for long-running operations (like database queries, file I/O, API calls), 
the program continues doing other work.

Why do we need it?

Improve performance
Increase responsiveness
Avoid UI freezing (in desktop/mobile apps)
Handle high-concurrency (in web apps)

var data = GetData();   // program waits here
Console.WriteLine("Done"); 

var data = await GetDataAsync(); // does NOT block
Console.WriteLine("Done");       // runs after task finishes

-------------------------------------------------------------
Code First vs Database First
Code First: You create C# model classes first, and EF generates the database using migrations. Best for new projects and domain-driven development.

Database First: You start with an existing database, and EF generates classes from it (scaffolding). Best for legacy databases or DB-first environments.

When to use Code First:

New project (no existing database)
Domain-driven design (DDD)
Want full control over models & migrations
Agile / fast development cycles

✔ Pros:
Full control over the domain model
Easy migrations (add, update, rollback)
Cleaner, modern approach (.NET Core default)

✔ Cons:
Requires EF Core knowledge
Not ideal if database already exists
Harder when DB structure is complex or controlled by DBAs

When to use Database First:

You already have a production database
Database is large/complex
DB schema is managed by DBAs
You want models to match exactly what's in DB

✔ Pros:
Perfect for legacy databases
No risk of EF creating wrong structure
Faster when DB already exists

✔ Cons:

Models are tightly coupled to database schema
Changing the DB requires re-scaffolding
Migrations become harder or disabled
Not ideal for domain-driven design

-------------------------------------------------------------
How migrations work in Code First
Migrations in EF Core are a way to:

Track changes to your model (classes)
Generate SQL files automatically
Apply database schema updates safely

How it works:
You write POCO classes
Configure them using attributes or Fluent API
Run migrations → EF generates tables, relations, constraints

Add-Migration AddEmailToStudent
Update-Database

EF reads all migration files in order
Finds which migrations have not yet run
Executes the SQL in the Up() methods
Updates a table in the database:

-------------------------------------------------------------
What are Indexes?
It helps the database find rows faster without scanning the entire table.

Why use indexes?
Speed up SELECT queries
Improve performance of search, sorting, JOINs, WHERE, ORDER BY
Reduce I/O operations

Downside:
Slows down INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
Takes additional memory space

-------------------------------------------------------------
Clustered vs Non-Clustered Indexes

Feature	 						Clustered Index				  Non-Clustered Index
Defines physical order of data	✔ Yes						  ❌ No
Number allowed per table		1							  Many
Storage							Actual table				  Separate from table
Speed							Faster						  Slightly slower (extra lookup)
Use case						Primary keys, unique values	  Searching frequently used columns
Pointer							Not needed					  Points to clustered index key / row
Best for						Range queries				  High-selectivity columns

-------------------------------------------------------------

Stored Procedures vs Views

Feature							Stored Procedure						View
Type							Program (SQL code block)				Virtual table
Contains						Multiple SQL statements + logic	Single 	SELECT query
Parameters						✔ Yes									❌ No
Return type						Result sets, output params				Result set only
Supports INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE	✔ Yes									❌ Usually No (except updatable views)
Logic (IF, loops)				✔ Yes									❌ No
Executes						Using CALL/EXEC							Using SELECT
Used for						Business logic							Data representation
Stores data?					❌ No									❌ No (only definition)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Morning:

Docker vs Container:
			
Feature		Docker											Container
Definition	A platform/tool to build & manage containers	A lightweight runtime environment for apps
Type		Technology / Software							The actual runtime instance
Purpose		Create, run, and orchestrate containers			Run the application in isolation
Includes	Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Hub			App + dependencies
Build?		Yes (Dockerfile → Image → Container)			No (container is the result)
Run?		Runs containers									The thing being run

-------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between Filter and Middleware

Feature							Middleware									Filter
Where it works					Entire request pipeline (before routing)	Only inside MVC pipeline (Controllers/Actions)
Purpose							Cross-cutting system-level concerns			Action-level concerns in MVC
Executes						From Program.cs pipeline					Around controller/action execution
Knows about Controller/Action?	❌ No										✔ Yes
Access to Model Binding, 
Action Context?					❌ No										✔ Yes
Order							Order added in Program.cs					Executes based on filter type & order
Types							Only one: middleware						Many types: Auth, Resource, Action, Exception, Result
Used for						Logging, routing, auth, compression, CORS	Validation, caching, authorization per action, exception handling
Runs for static files?			✔ Yes										❌ No

-------------------------------------------------------------

What is an Extension Method in C#

public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static int WordCount(this string str)
    {
        return str.Split(' ', StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
    }
}

string message = "Hello World from C#";
int count = message.WordCount();  // Looks like a built-in method

Has this keyword before the first parameter
→ This tells C# which type you are extending.

Even though you never modified the string class, it behaves like the method exists on it.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Event call in Microservices

In microservices, an event call means one service publishes an event, 
and one or more services react to it asynchronously.

➡️ It is asynchronous communication
➡️ Services do not call each other directly
➡️ They communicate through events via a message broker 
(Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, etc.)

Example: User places an order

1. Order Service publishes:
OrderCreatedEvent { OrderId = 1, UserId = 10, Amount = 200 }

2. Subscribers react:
Payment Service listens → charges card
Inventory Service listens → reduces stock
Notification Service listens → sends email

Order Service doesn't know who listens.
Subscribers don’t know who published.

This is decoupled asynchronous communication.

eg.

1. User places order
Order Service publishes event:
OrderCreatedEvent { OrderId = 101 }

2. RabbitMQ Exchange receives it
Exchange routes message to queues:
 → billing.queue
 → email.queue
 → inventory.queue

3. Billing Service consumes event
Processes payment

4. Email Service consumes event
Sends email: “Order Confirmed”

5. Inventory Service consumes event
Reduces stock

All services remain completely independent.

Use() vs Add() vs Run() vs Map()?

Use()

Adds middleware that can run before and after the next component.

● Run()

Adds terminal middleware that ends the pipeline and doesn’t call next.

● Map()

Branches the pipeline based on route/path.

● AddXXX()

Registers services to DI and configures the application — not part of the HTTP pipeline.

| Attribute Routing  | Optional (added in MVC5)     | Fully enabled            | Primary method       |

-------------------------------------------------------------
What is CORS?

CORS allows a server to specify which external origins can access its resources, 
preventing unauthorized cross-domain attacks. 
ASP.NET Core implements CORS using middleware and policies.

Origin = protocol + domain + port

builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AllowClient", policy =>
        policy.WithOrigins("https://myapp.com")
              .AllowAnyHeader()
              .AllowAnyMethod());
});

app.UseCors("AllowClient");

When Should You Enable CORS?

✔ SPA frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
✔ Different frontend + backend domains
✔ Microservices
✔ API Gateway to downstream services
-------------------------------------------------------------
What is a Reverse Proxy?

A Reverse Proxy is a server that sits between the client and backend services:

✔ You want to hide microservices behind a gateway
✔ Forwards requests to downstream APIs
✔ Hides backend URLs
✔ Handles routing, load balancing, caching, SSL termination, etc.

Nginx
Apache
IIS
YARP (.NET reverse proxy)

| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Type         | Protocol                   | Architectural style           |
| Data format  | XML only                   | JSON, XML, HTML, text         |
| Ease of use  | Complex                    | Simple                        |
| Speed        | Slower (heavy XML)         | Fast (lightweight)            |
| Transport    | Any (HTTP, SMTP, TCP)      | HTTP only                     |
| Security     | Very strong (WS-Security)  | Relies on HTTP (HTTPS, OAuth) |

Global exception handling?

Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core allows you to catch all unhandled exceptions in one central place, 
instead of writing try-catch blocks everywhere in controllers or services.


Why Do We Need Global Exception Handling?

Without global handling, every unhandled exception:
Crashes the request
Produces random HTTP 500 pages
Returns inconsistent responses
Pollutes logs

With global handling:
One middleware handles ALL exceptions
Standard error format
Consistent HTTP status codes

| Approach                        | When to Use                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **UseExceptionHandler()**       | Most production-ready apps; simple + reliable |
| **Custom Exception Middleware** | Pure APIs, microservices, need custom JSON    |
| **Filters**                     | Only inside MVC, not global pipeline          |


Using UseExceptionHandler() (Built-in Middleware)

Best for APIs and MVC apps.

Program.cs:

app.UseExceptionHandler("/error");


ErrorController.cs

[ApiController]
public class ErrorController : ControllerBase
{
    [Route("error")]
    public IActionResult HandleError() =>
        Problem();  // Returns RFC 7807 standard error response
}


✔ Clean
✔ Built-in
✔ Recommended for production

🔷 2. Custom Exception Handling Middleware

Used when you want full control.

Middleware:

public class GlobalExceptionMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public GlobalExceptionMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<GlobalExceptionMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            await _next(context); // call next middleware
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Unhandled exception");
            context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
            context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";

            var response = new { message = "Something went wrong." };
            await context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync(response);
        }
    }
}


Register it:

app.UseMiddleware<GlobalExceptionMiddleware>();

The Unit of Work (UoW) pattern:
Manages a group of repository transactions as a single atomic operation.

In EF Core, the DbContext itself is a unit of work (because SaveChanges is transactional).

But UoW pattern:
Groups multiple repositories
Provides a single Save() method
Ensures all DB operations succeed together or rollback together

public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    IGenericRepository<Product> Products { get; }
    IGenericRepository<Category> Categories { get; }
    Task<int> SaveAsync();
}

public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _context;

    public IGenericRepository<Product> Products { get; }
    public IGenericRepository<Category> Categories { get; }

    public UnitOfWork(AppDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
        Products = new GenericRepository<Product>(_context);
        Categories = new GenericRepository<Category>(_context);
    }

    public async Task<int> SaveAsync()
    {
        return await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _context.Dispose();
    }
}

public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IUnitOfWork _unitOfWork;

    public ProductService(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork)
    {
        _unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
    }

    public async Task AddProduct(Product p)
    {
        await _unitOfWork.Products.AddAsync(p);
        await _unitOfWork.SaveAsync();
    }
}

App performance tuning in .NET?

Use AsNoTracking for read queries
Avoid Lazy Loading → N+1 problem
Use caching aggressively
Reduce middleware pipeline
Prefer async/await everywhere
Optimize EF queries (Include, projections, filtering)
Use Response Compression and Caching
Reduce garbage collection pressure (Span/Pool/ValueTask)
Profile your application regularly
Use Redis for distributed cache & performance


Code-Level Optimizations
✔ Avoid unnecessary object allocations
// Bad: allocates every loop iteration
var list = new List<int>();

// Good: specify capacity
var list = new List<int>(1000);

✔ Use Span<T> / Memory<T> for high-performance memory operations (C# 7.2+).
✔ Avoid boxing/unboxing

Use generics instead of object.

✔ Use StringBuilder for string concatenation in loops.
✔ Prefer asynchronous APIs

Async releases threads → more scalable APIs.

⚡ 3. ASP.NET Core Performance
✔ Use Response Caching
app.UseResponseCaching();

[ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]
public IActionResult GetData() => Ok();

✔ Enable Compression (Brotli/Gzip)
services.AddResponseCompression();

✔ Minimize Middleware

Each middleware adds overhead. Remove unused ones.

✔ Use IHttpContextAccessor sparingly.

It’s expensive; inject HttpContext only where needed.

🗂 4. Database Performance (EF Core)
✔ Use AsNoTracking for read-only queries
var data = context.Users.AsNoTracking().ToList();

✔ Avoid Lazy Loading → Causes N+1 issues

Prefer Eager or Explicit loading.

✔ Use Compiled Queries for frequently-used queries
✔ Optimize LINQ Queries

Don’t evaluate on client side.

✔ Index the database properly (Clustered, Non-Clustered)
✔ Batch SaveChanges
await context.SaveChangesAsync();


Instead of saving inside loops.

🧵 5. Multithreading & Async Improvements
✔ Avoid blocking calls

❌ Task.Result
❌ Task.Wait()

Always use:
✔ await

✔ Use ValueTask for performance-critical async calls

Reduces allocations for short-lived operations.

🧰 6. Caching Strategies
🔹 In-Memory Caching

For small, frequently accessed data.

🔹 Distributed Cache (Redis)

For multi-server deployments / microservices.

🔹 Output Caching (.NET 8 feature)
🔹 Don’t cache large objects unnecessarily

Avoid LOH (Large Object Heap) pressure.

📦 7. Memory Optimizations
✔ Remove unused DI services

Every service consumes memory.

✔ Clean up IDisposable

Use:

using var stream = ...

✔ Avoid large in-memory collections if not needed.
✔ Use ArrayPool<T> / ObjectPool<T>

Reduces GC pressure.

🧪 8. Logging & Diagnostics
✔ Reduce logging level in Production

Use only:

Information

Error

Critical

✔ Enable Application Insights / OpenTelemetry for tracing.
✔ Use dotnet-trace, dotnet-dump, and dotnet-counters for performance profiling.
🖧 9. API Response Optimization
✔ Return IAsyncEnumerable<T> for streaming large lists
✔ Use Minimal APIs (lightweight compared to MVC)
✔ Compress JSON (System.Text.Json faster than Newtonsoft)
services.AddControllers()
    .AddJsonOptions(o => o.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy = null);

🏎 10. Deployment Optimizations
✔ Enable ReadyToRun (AOT compilation)

Improves startup time.

✔ Publish using --self-contained for runtime optimization.
✔ Use Kestrel + Reverse Proxy (Nginx/IIS)
✔ Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for better network performance.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Caching strategies?

hat Is Caching?

Caching is the technique of storing frequently accessed data in fast storage (memory, Redis, file) so future requests can access it quickly without recomputing or hitting the database.

🧩 Types of Caching Strategies
1️⃣ In-Memory Cache (IMemoryCache)

Stored in application memory, fastest cache.

✔ Best for:

Single server deployments

Small data (< few MBs)

Frequently accessed, rarely changed data

Example:
services.AddMemoryCache();

public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;

    public ProductService(IMemoryCache cache)
    {
        _cache = cache;
    }

    public Product GetProduct(int id)
    {
        return _cache.GetOrCreate($"product_{id}", entry =>
        {
            entry.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);
            return db.Products.Find(id);
        });
    }
}

2️⃣ Distributed Cache (Redis / SQL Server Cache)

Stored outside the application, in Redis or SQL.

✔ Best for:

Load-balanced / multi-server applications

Microservices

Large caching needs

Example:
services.AddStackExchangeRedisCache(options =>
{
    options.Configuration = "localhost:6379";
});

3️⃣ Response Caching

Caches entire HTTP responses.

✔ Best for:

GET endpoints returning static or semi-static data

Public APIs with largely identical responses

app.UseResponseCaching();

[ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]
public IActionResult Get() => Ok();

4️⃣ Output Caching (New in .NET 8)

More powerful than response caching:

Can cache POST responses

Supports tags, vary-by, invalidation

builder.Services.AddOutputCache();

app.MapGet("/products", () => data).CacheOutput();

5️⃣ Client-Side Caching

Use browser cache headers.

Examples:

Cache-Control

ETag

Last-Modified

✔ Best for:

Static files

Images, CSS, JS

app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
{
    OnPrepareResponse = ctx =>
    {
        ctx.Context.Response.Headers["Cache-Control"] = "public,max-age=86400";
    }
});

6️⃣ Distributed Memory Caching (Hybrid)

Combination of in-memory + Redis, where local memory is used for fast reads, Redis for consistency.

7️⃣ Query Caching (EF Core)

Cache repeated database calls manually like:

var users = await _cache.GetOrCreateAsync("users_all", async e =>
{
    e.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
    return await context.Users.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();
});

🧠 Caching Patterns (Strategies)
🔥 A. Absolute Expiration

Cache expires after fixed duration.

entry.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);


✔ Predictable
✘ Might serve stale data

🔥 B. Sliding Expiration

Resets expiration time each time the cache is accessed.

entry.SlidingExpiration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);


✔ Great for frequently accessed but rarely updated data
✘ Cache may stay forever if constantly used

🔥 C. Cache Aside (Lazy Loading)

Most common pattern.

Check cache

If not found → load from DB

Put data into cache

Return

✔ Simple
✔ Efficient
✔ Works for most apps

🔥 D. Write-Through Cache

When data is written to DB, it's also written to cache immediately.

✔ Cache always consistent
✘ Slight write performance hit

🔥 E. Write-Behind Cache

Write to cache → DB updated later in background.

✔ Super fast writes
✘ Risk of data inconsistency

🔥 F. Read-Through Cache

Application always reads through the cache provider, which loads from DB automatically.

✔ Encapsulated, clean
✘ Provider complexity

🔥 G. Cache Invalidation Strategies

The hardest part of caching.

Techniques:

Time-based expiration

Manual invalidation via key

Tag-based invalidation (Output Cache / Redis)

Event-based invalidation (e.g., on DB change)

-------------------------------------------------------------

What is ACID?

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
It ensures that database transactions execute reliably.
Atomicity ensures all-or-nothing, 
consistency ensures rules are followed, 
isolation ensures concurrency safety, 
and durability ensures data is permanent after commit.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Normalization vs denormalization?

normalization reduces redundancy by splitting data into multiple related tables, improving data integrity but requiring more joins.

Denormalization combines tables to reduce joins and speed up read operations but introduces redundancy and consistency challenges.

Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

🎯 Goal:

Avoid duplicate data

Ensure consistent data

Create efficient updates/inserts

📌 Techniques include:

1NF — Remove repeating groups

2NF — Remove partial dependencies

3NF — Remove transitive dependencies

BCNF, 4NF, 5NF (advanced)

✔ Example of Normalization
❌ Denormalized table (repeating data)
OrderId	CustomerName	CustomerCity	Product	Price
1	John	NYC	Laptop	1000
2	John	NYC	Mouse	20

Customer info is repeated.

✔ Normalized tables

Customers table:

CustomerId	Name	City
1	John	NYC

Orders table:

OrderId	CustomerId	Product	Price
1	1	Laptop	1000
2	1	Mouse	20

No repetition → better integrity.

🎯 When to Use Normalization

OLTP systems (transactional apps)

Banking, finance, inventory systems

Write-heavy systems

When consistency and data integrity matter most

👍 Benefits

Eliminates duplicates

Saves storage

Easier updates (data in one place)

Strong integrity & consistency

👎 Drawbacks

More joins → slower reads

More tables → more complex queries

🚀 Denormalization

Denormalization is the process of combining tables to improve read performance by reducing joins — at the cost of more redundant data.

🎯 Goal:

Faster reads

Pre-joined, pre-computed data

Better performance for reporting

✔ Example of Denormalization

Instead of splitting:

Customers table
Orders table

We combine into one table:

OrderId	CustomerName	City	Product	Price
1	John	NYC	Laptop	1000
2	John	NYC	Mouse	20

No joins → faster read.

🎯 When to Use Denormalization

OLAP / analytics / reporting

Read-heavy workloads

Data warehousing

Microservices where joins across services aren't possible

Caching and materialized views

👍 Benefits

Faster read performance (fewer joins)

Simplifies query logic

Good for reporting and dashboards

👎 Drawbacks

Data redundancy

Update anomalies

Harder to maintain consistency

More storage required

🆚 Normalization vs Denormalization (Comparison Table)
Feature	Normalization	Denormalization
Goal	Reduce redundancy	Improve read performance
Data Integrity	High	Lower
Storage	Low	High
Read Performance	Slower (more joins)	Faster
Write Performance	Faster	Slower
Use Cases	OLTP	OLAP / Reporting
Complexity	More tables	Fewer tables
